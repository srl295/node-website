## Discussions

### Releases

#### v0.12.3

JGI: some progress , still slow. 
On v8 upgrade [#9185](https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/9185), made progress, trevor is working on until next week.
Additional patches all in the comments.
Help wanted to finish v8 integration.

#### Profiler

JGI: [#14576](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/14576) An issue - profiler causing v8 to stall?

#### FreeBSD flag

JGI: [#8540](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/8540)  - FreeBSD flag. Input needed. The parameter is exposed to JS.

JGI: finishing other P-1 issues before release

#### Bar Mitzvah

JGI: [#15445](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/15445) - Bar Mitzvah issue - 2 questions, feedback needed.

* Need to be able to get prior (insecure) behavior back if needed
* how best to name the option?

MD: don't want to do this in perpetuity - RC4. Expand documentation.

SRL: should it be named 'enable-insecure'?

JGI: always possible for users to specify custom cipher lists. 

TJ: balance between platform users and application users

JGI: need to get the main scenarios, come up with use cases first

MD: this is a tempoary fix, most people (hopefully) are using defaults.

TJ: this [setting] is [used] more in minor versions, when people are bringing up [some version of an] app.

#### Wrong checksum for node v0.12.2

* This issue will be investigated. (by whom?)

### Leap Second

SRL: leap second [#9382](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9382)

SRL: probably can't do more testing

TJ / JGI: - did a test suitewith faketime. That may not work on windows.

TJ: "no known issues" - some may want more documentation

TJ:  blog post , link to documentation/faq

TJ / AC:clock used on windows for 0.10 is less precise but still monotonic

MD: google response on v8 - "thats a good qeustion"

TJ: this should be first class documentation.

- [ ] srl, open a new ticket. Document that Date.now  != how timers work.
(`doc/timers`)

JGI: Need to document openssl upgrades

* such upgrades can be confusing
* often these upgrades are done in 'less than ideal' situations
[pressure to fix a critical issue]

#### Documenting how to update v8

* James and Julien are working on docs of how to do the update, 
* missing some of the history, but at least it can be well understood
* ideally anyone on the team or community can understand how it is done

TJ: no specific home for this doc, in the wiki right now (link)

* also one on v8 - may not include all floating patches

TJ:   [docs] should live in the code eventually
JGI:  may take another form. 

- [ ] SRL: action to document how to upgrade ICU

### Joint node.js/io.js

CI: joint TC call

* People don't want extra meetings - may be a little disorganized

TJ: - hard but necessary -- there's a lot of work to do around merging two projects

* need to work together to maintain stable release (LTS/platform etc)
has to be comfortable integrating into the entire project
* innovation + ideals of LTS working group.  Required amount of tension
* hopefully good agendas

SRL: more of a concatenation than a merge. agenda and time management
will become critical

TJ: time management - "we have 5 minutes to discuss this".

* proposed time is "Wednesday and it has been 1pm-2pm pacific since PDT
kicked in (it was noon-1 before that)."

ALL: This time seemed good

SRL: formal scheduling of agenda items?

TJ: yes, people should propose a time length when items come in

JGI: two goals - 1. identify divergence, and 2. get used to other members

JGI:  maybe, :15 joint meeting [ then individual meetings ]

### Bug triage

JGI: call to triage incoming bugs

SRL: I wasn't able to relabel tickets

TJ: will fix (fixed)

### Crash from command line (Intl)

* crash from command line? [#9361](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9361)

 * (SRL to investigate)
